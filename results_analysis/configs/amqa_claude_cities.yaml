# ── AMQA × Claude – City Demographic Composition Config ──────────────────────
#
# Each city defines the demographic composition for three bias types:
#   ethnicity  →  white / black
#   gender     →  male / female
#   SES        →  high_income / low_income
#
# Proportions within each bias type must sum to 1.0.
# Counts are derived as:  round(proportion × n_samples)
