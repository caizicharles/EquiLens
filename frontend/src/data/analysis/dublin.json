      "summary": "Counterfactual fairness demands that a model's output should not change when only a patient's demographic attributes are altered while all clinical facts remain constant. Dublin provides a particularly informative test case because its 50/50 gender split offers the most symmetric and statistically balanced probe of gender fairness among the three cities.\n\nDublin was evaluated with demographic compositions of 90% white / 10% black (ethnicity), 50% male / 50% female (gender), and 80% high-income / 20% low-income (SES). Ten clinical scenarios were each presented with and without demographic cues, measuring consistency and accuracy against a demographic-free baseline (baseline accuracy = 0.90).",
      "findings": "Dublin is the most demographically fair deployment target of the three cities. Gender and SES framing produce zero detectable bias, with perfect 1.0 consistency ratios and unchanged accuracy across both dimensions — the model treats male/female and high-income/low-income framings identically. The 50/50 gender split provides the most rigorous and symmetric test of gender fairness, and the clean result lends confidence that the model's gender-invariant behavior is genuine rather than an artifact of skewed composition. The only concern is the universal ethnicity consistency signal: a consistency ratio of 0.889, identical to Edinburgh's and driven by the same model-level tendency toward greater instability under Black demographic framing. This is not a Dublin-specific vulnerability but a model-intrinsic one — it appears in every city regardless of local composition. The identical values for Dublin and Edinburgh (both 90/10 white/black) versus London's 0.875 (80/20) further support that the underlying per-scenario instability rate is constant, with numerical differences driven entirely by composition-weighted sampling.",
      "verdict": "RECOMMENDED. Dublin has the cleanest fairness profile: perfect gender and SES consistency, with only the shared model-level ethnicity signal (0.889) present. The ethnicity signal warrants monitoring but does not constitute a deployment-blocking violation given that it is universal across all cities and does not degrade accuracy.",
      "recommendation": "Apply ethnicity-focused counterfactual augmentation during training — pairing each clinical scenario with race-swapped variants and adding a consistency regularization loss — to eliminate the 0.889 ethnicity consistency ratio that persists model-wide. No gender or SES remediation is needed for Dublin."

      "summary": "When a model underperforms not in one domain but across all of them, the concern shifts from a specific blind spot to a systemic competence issue — suggesting the model may be poorly calibrated to the clinical patterns most relevant to a given population. This experiment tests whether Claude Sonnet 4.6's performance across Dublin's disease burden reveals isolated gaps or a broader weakness.\n\nDublin's clinical scenario mix reflects its disease burden, which features a notably higher cardiovascular weight than the other cities: cancer (42.5%), cardiovascular (39.7%), and respiratory (17.8%). All 100 scenarios produced valid responses. Performance was measured via accuracy and macro F1 at both the aggregate and per-disease level.",
      "findings": "Dublin shows the weakest overall performance of the three cities, and uniquely, the weakness is not confined to a single domain. The aggregate accuracy of 85.0% (F1 = 0.826) trails Edinburgh by 9 points and London by ~5 points. All three disease categories underperform their counterparts in other cities: cancer at 88.4% (vs. 98.1% London, 96.2% Edinburgh), cardiovascular at 85.4% (vs. 95.2% London, 96.2% Edinburgh), and respiratory at 75.0% (vs. 86.4% Edinburgh). These gaps range from approximately 8 to 11 points depending on the comparison, suggesting a systematic rather than domain-specific issue. Respiratory accuracy at 75.0% (F1 = 0.729) is the standout floor — the model gets one in four respiratory scenarios wrong — though the small sample (n=16) means this estimate carries wider confidence intervals. The cardiovascular result (85.4%, F1 = 0.836) is arguably more consequential: cardiovascular disease represents 39.7% of Dublin's disease composition — the highest cardiovascular weight across all cities — meaning this moderate shortfall impacts the largest share of Dublin's clinical interactions. The within-city spread of 13.4 points (88.4% → 75.0%) is moderate, but the uniformly depressed baseline across all domains is the more concerning pattern. This broad underperformance may reflect that Dublin's clinical topic mix samples from harder subtopics, or that the model is less calibrated to the clinical patterns most relevant to Dublin's population.",
      "verdict": "NOT RECOMMENDED. The 85.0% aggregate accuracy with respiratory at 75.0% and cardiovascular at 85.4% falls below acceptable clinical deployment thresholds. Cardiovascular disease represents nearly 40% of Dublin's disease burden, and performance in that domain is insufficient. The universally depressed performance across all domains relative to other cities indicates a systematic competence gap rather than an isolated, fixable weakness.",
      "recommendation": "Conduct targeted fine-tuning prioritizing cardiovascular and respiratory medicine — given their combined 57.5% weight in Dublin's disease profile — using a curriculum that over-samples Irish and UK clinical guidelines and epidemiological contexts. Investigate whether Dublin's clinical topic mix draws from more difficult or niche subtopics and augment training data accordingly to address the systematic 8–11 point accuracy depression across all domains."

      "summary": "Dublin's counterfactual fairness compositions are 90% white / 10% black, 50% male / 50% female, and 80% high-income / 20% low-income. The disease-domain assessment mix reflects Dublin's higher cardiovascular burden: cancer (42.5%), cardiovascular (39.7%), and respiratory (17.8%).",
      "findings": "Dublin presents the most concerning overall disease-domain performance of the three cities, with an aggregate accuracy of 85.0% and uniformly depressed scores across all disease categories. The 75.0% respiratory accuracy is the standout weakness, but even cancer (88.4%) and cardiovascular (85.4%) fall substantially below their counterparts in London and Edinburgh. This broad underperformance suggests that Dublin's specific clinical topic mix — or the epidemiological domains most relevant to Dublin's population — expose general model weaknesses rather than isolated gaps. The counterfactual fairness results are paradoxically the most favorable: gender and SES framings produce perfect consistency, with only the shared ethnicity signal (0.889) persisting. The combination of clean fairness metrics with weak domain performance suggests that Dublin's risk is primarily one of competence rather than bias.",
      "verdict": "⚠️ NOT RECOMMENDED for deployment in Dublin without performance improvements. The 85.0% aggregate accuracy with respiratory at 75.0% and cardiovascular at 85.4% falls below acceptable thresholds, particularly given cardiovascular disease represents nearly 40% of Dublin's relevant disease burden. The universally depressed performance relative to other cities indicates a systematic competence gap.",
      "recommendation": "Conduct targeted fine-tuning on the specific clinical domains where Dublin underperforms — prioritizing cardiovascular and respiratory medicine given their combined 57.5% weight in Dublin's disease profile — using a curriculum that over-samples Irish and UK clinical guidelines and epidemiological contexts. Investigate whether Dublin's clinical topic mix samples from more difficult or niche subtopics (e.g., valvular heart disease, COPD management) and augment training data accordingly to address the systematic 8–11 point accuracy depression observed across all disease domains."
