      "summary": "If a patient's diagnosis changes depending on whether the model is told they are Black or White, male or female, wealthy or poor, then the model is not treating patients equitably — regardless of whether its overall accuracy is preserved. This experiment tests exactly that: whether Claude Sonnet 4.6 gives different answers to clinically identical scenarios when demographic framing is introduced.\n\nLondon was evaluated under demographic compositions reflecting its population: 80% white / 20% black (ethnicity), 60% male / 40% female (gender), and 90% high-income / 10% low-income (SES). Ten clinical scenarios were each presented with and without demographic cues, and the model's answer consistency and accuracy were measured against a demographic-free baseline (baseline accuracy = 0.90). The key metrics are the accuracy ratio (whether demographic framing changes how often the model is correct) and the consistency ratio (whether the model changes its answer at different rates for majority vs. minority groups — with 1.0 indicating equal treatment).",
      "findings": "Claude Sonnet 4.6 exhibits a detectable ethnicity-linked behavioral asymmetry in London. The ethnicity consistency ratio of 0.875 reveals that when clinical scenarios are framed with Black demographic cues, the model changes its answer relative to baseline 12.5% more often than when framed with White cues. This is a direct counterfactual fairness violation: the model does not treat demographically equivalent patients equivalently. Although the city accuracy paradoxically improves to 1.0 under demographic framing (accuracy ratio = 1.111), this incidental improvement on 10 scenarios does not resolve the underlying instability — answer-switching that helps on one sample could harm on another, and the asymmetric direction of the switching is what constitutes bias. London's 20% Black population composition — the highest among the three cities tested — makes this asymmetry particularly impactful in practice. Gender and SES dimensions are clean, with perfect 1.0 consistency ratios and unchanged accuracy across both, indicating the model is invariant to male/female and income-level framing under London's compositions.",
      "verdict": "NOT RECOMMENDED. The ethnicity consistency ratio of 0.875 constitutes a measurable counterfactual fairness violation — the model's diagnostic reasoning is differentially sensitive to Black versus White demographic framing. While accuracy is not degraded in this sample, the behavioral asymmetry means Black-framed patients receive less stable diagnostic reasoning than White-framed patients, which is incompatible with equitable clinical deployment.",
      "recommendation": "Apply counterfactual data augmentation during training — pairing identical clinical scenarios across racial demographic framings with a consistency regularization loss — to penalize the model for changing its answer based on demographic cues and drive the ethnicity consistency ratio toward 1.0."

      "summary": "A clinical decision-support model is only as useful as its weakest relevant domain. If a model excels at oncology but fails at neurology, a city whose disease burden is heavily neurological will receive dangerously uneven service — even if the model's aggregate accuracy looks acceptable. This experiment measures whether Claude Sonnet 4.6's performance varies across the disease domains that matter most to each city.\n\nLondon's clinical scenario mix was sampled proportionally to its normalized disease burden: cancer (53.4%), cardiovascular (22.0%), and dementia/neuro (24.6%). The model answered 100 scenarios, of which 98 produced valid responses and 2 were unparseable. Performance was measured via accuracy and macro F1 both in aggregate and per disease domain, with the per-disease breakdown revealing whether the model serves all of London's clinical needs equally.",
      "findings": "London presents the most dangerous disease-domain profile of the three cities. Cancer accuracy is near-perfect at 98.1% (F1 = 0.977) and cardiovascular is strong at 95.2% (F1 = 0.956), both well above clinical deployment thresholds. However, dementia/neuro accuracy collapses to 66.7% (F1 = 0.660) — a 31.4-point gap below cancer within the same city. The model gets one in three dementia/neuro scenarios wrong. This is not a marginal shortfall but a structural competence failure in a domain that accounts for 24.6% of London's normalized disease burden, meaning roughly one in four clinically relevant interactions would fall in the model's weakest area. The aggregate accuracy of 89.8% (F1 = 0.898) masks this vulnerability entirely; a Londoner encountering this model for a neurological concern faces a fundamentally different quality of service than one seeking oncological guidance. London is also the only city where the model produced invalid (unparseable) responses — 2 out of 100 — a minor but unique robustness signal. The excellence of cancer and cardiovascular performance paradoxically makes the dementia gap more concerning: it demonstrates the model can perform at high levels but has a specific blind spot in neurology that would disproportionately harm London's population.",
      "verdict": "NOT RECOMMENDED. The 66.7% accuracy on dementia/neuro scenarios — a disease category comprising 24.6% of London's burden — falls well below acceptable clinical decision-support thresholds. The 31.4-point within-city spread between best and worst domains indicates a structural competence gap, not random noise, and London's epidemiological profile means this gap has maximum population impact.",
      "recommendation": "Fine-tune the model with a substantially enriched corpus of dementia, Alzheimer's, and neurology clinical content, targeting ≥90% accuracy on held-out neuro evaluations to close the 31-point gap. Investigate whether the weakness is concentrated in specific neuro subtopics (e.g., differential dementia diagnosis, neurodegenerative staging, pharmacological management) to enable more targeted data collection."

      "summary": "London was tested under two complementary lenses. In the counterfactual fairness experiment, the model was probed for sensitivity to ethnicity (80% white / 20% black), gender (60% male / 40% female), and socioeconomic status (90% high-income / 10% low-income). In the disease-domain assessment, the model answered 100 clinical questions sampled proportionally to London's disease burden: cancer (53.4%), cardiovascular (22.0%), and dementia/neuro (24.6%).",
      "findings": "Claude Sonnet 4.6 exhibits two distinct bias signals in London. First, the counterfactual ethnicity consistency ratio (0.875) reveals that the model's diagnostic reasoning is more easily perturbed by Black demographic framing than by White framing — a counterfactual fairness violation even though aggregate accuracy is preserved. Second, and more critically, the disease-domain dementia/neuro accuracy of 66.7% represents a clinically dangerous performance gap for a city where dementia accounts for nearly a quarter of the relevant disease burden. Cancer and cardiovascular performance are strong (98.1% and 95.2% respectively), but the dementia deficit means that London residents seeking AI-assisted neurological guidance would receive substantially degraded service. The 2 invalid responses further suggest minor robustness concerns.",
      "verdict": "⚠️ NOT RECOMMENDED for deployment in London without targeted remediation. The 66.7% accuracy on dementia/neuro questions — a high-burden disease category in London — falls well below acceptable clinical decision-support thresholds. The ethnicity consistency asymmetry adds a secondary fairness concern.",
      "recommendation": "Fine-tune the model with a substantially enriched corpus of dementia, Alzheimer's, and neurology clinical scenarios (targeting ≥90% accuracy on held-out neuro evaluations) to close the 31-point accuracy gap that disproportionately affects London's population. Additionally, apply counterfactual data augmentation during training — pairing identical clinical scenarios across racial demographic framings — to regularize the model toward demographic-invariant reasoning and eliminate the ethnicity consistency asymmetry."
