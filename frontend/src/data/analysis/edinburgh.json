      "summary": "A model that produces different diagnostic answers depending on whether a patient is described as male or female — even when the clinical details are identical — introduces a gendered layer of unreliability that undermines trust. This experiment probes whether Claude Sonnet 4.6 exhibits such differential behavior under Edinburgh's real-world demographic composition.\n\nEdinburgh was evaluated with compositions of 90% white / 10% black (ethnicity), 40% male / 60% female (gender — female is the population majority, but male is treated as the \"majority\" group in the experimental framework), and 90% high-income / 10% low-income (SES). The same 10 clinical scenarios were presented with and without demographic cues, measuring consistency and accuracy against a demographic-free baseline (baseline accuracy = 0.90).",
      "findings": "Edinburgh presents the most complex demographic fairness profile of the three cities, surfacing bias signals across two dimensions simultaneously. The gender consistency ratio of 1.200 is the single largest demographic bias signal detected across all cities and all dimensions in this experiment: the model is 20% more likely to maintain its baseline answer when a scenario is framed as male versus female. This means female-framed clinical scenarios induce meaningfully more answer-switching than male-framed ones — and because Edinburgh's population is 60% female, the demographic group experiencing greater instability is also the larger population group. The ethnicity consistency ratio of 0.889 mirrors the pattern shared across all cities, confirming a model-level tendency toward greater instability under Black demographic framing. Neither bias degrades accuracy (both accuracy ratios are ≥1.0), but the differential behavioral stability across demographic groups violates counterfactual fairness: clinically identical patients receive different treatment depending on how they are demographically described. SES framing remains clean with a perfect 1.0 consistency ratio.",
      "verdict": "NOT RECOMMENDED. Edinburgh has two active demographic bias dimensions. The gender consistency ratio of 1.200 — a 20% stability gap favoring male-framed over female-framed scenarios — is the strongest bias signal in the entire experiment, and it disproportionately affects Edinburgh's 60% female majority. Combined with the ethnicity signal (0.889), the model cannot be considered demographically fair for Edinburgh deployment.",
      "recommendation": "Introduce gender-balanced counterfactual augmentation during fine-tuning, ensuring every clinical scenario is presented with both male and female framings at equal frequency, with a consistency loss that explicitly penalizes differential answer-switching rates across gender. Extend the same augmentation approach to ethnicity to address the secondary 0.889 consistency signal."

    "disease_only": {
      "summary": "Even a high-performing model can create health inequities if its performance is concentrated in some disease domains and weak in others — because different cities carry different disease burdens. This experiment tests whether Claude Sonnet 4.6's clinical competence is balanced across the disease domains most relevant to Edinburgh, or whether composition-driven luck is masking domain-specific weaknesses.\n\nEdinburgh's clinical scenario mix reflects its normalized disease burden: cancer (54.4%), cardiovascular (23.9%), and respiratory (21.7%). All 100 scenarios produced valid responses. Performance was measured via accuracy and macro F1 at both the aggregate and per-disease level.",
      "findings": "Edinburgh delivers the strongest overall performance of the three cities: 94.0% aggregate accuracy (F1 = 0.937) with zero invalid responses. Cancer and cardiovascular domains are tied at 96.2% accuracy, both with macro F1 scores above 0.95, indicating not just high accuracy but balanced performance across answer classes. Respiratory is the weakest domain at 86.4% (F1 = 0.890), creating a within-city spread of 9.8 points — substantially less severe than London's 31.4-point dementia gap or Dublin's 13.4-point spread. At 21.7% of Edinburgh's disease composition, the population impact of the respiratory shortfall is moderate. Edinburgh's top ranking is partly a composition advantage: its disease burden is heaviest in the domains where the model excels (cancer and cardiovascular combined = 78.3%) and lightest in its weakest area (respiratory 21.7%). This alignment, rather than any Edinburgh-specific model advantage, likely explains the city's strong aggregate numbers. Nonetheless, the respiratory F1 of 0.890 remains clinically serviceable, and no domain falls below the point where deployment risk becomes unacceptable.",
      "verdict": "RECOMMENDED. The 94.0% aggregate accuracy, 9.8-point maximum within-city spread, and zero invalid responses all meet clinical deployment thresholds. Respiratory performance (86.4%) warrants ongoing monitoring given its 21.7% composition weight, but does not constitute a deployment-blocking weakness.",
      "recommendation": "Supplement the respiratory medicine training corpus to close the ~10-point gap with cancer/cardiovascular and push respiratory accuracy above 90%. This is a targeted enhancement rather than a critical fix — Edinburgh's profile is already deployment-viable."

    "combined": {
      "summary": "Edinburgh was tested with counterfactual fairness demographic compositions of 90% white / 10% black (ethnicity), 40% male / 60% female (gender — note: female is the majority in real population but male is treated as the \"majority\" group in the framework), and 90% high-income / 10% low-income (SES). The disease-domain assessment mix reflects Edinburgh's disease burden: cancer (54.4%), cardiovascular (23.9%), and respiratory (21.7%).",
      "findings": "Edinburgh presents a mixed but largely favorable profile. The model achieves the highest aggregate disease-domain accuracy of the three cities (94.0%) with balanced cross-domain performance and zero invalid outputs. However, the counterfactual fairness experiment surfaces a unique gender consistency anomaly: a consistency ratio of 1.200 indicates that female-framed questions induce 20% more answer-switching than male-framed questions relative to baseline. Given that Edinburgh's population is 60% female, this asymmetry means the majority of the city's residents would interact with a less behaviorally stable version of the model. The shared ethnicity consistency signal (0.889) is also present. Respiratory accuracy at 86.4% is adequate but warrants monitoring given the 21.7% disease composition weight.",
      "verdict": "CONDITIONALLY RECOMMENDED for deployment in Edinburgh with mandatory monitoring of gender-stratified performance. The strong disease-domain performance (94.0%) and balanced disease-domain accuracy support deployment, but the gender consistency ratio of 1.200 represents a meaningful fairness concern that should be tracked in production and addressed in the next model iteration.",
      "recommendation": "Introduce gender-balanced counterfactual augmentation during fine-tuning, ensuring that every medical question is presented with both male and female framings at equal frequency, to eliminate the 20% gender consistency gap that disproportionately affects female-framed reasoning. Supplement the respiratory medicine training corpus to close the 10-point gap with cancer/cardiovascular and push respiratory accuracy above 90%."
