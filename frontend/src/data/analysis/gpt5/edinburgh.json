      "summary": "A model that produces different diagnostic answers depending on whether a patient is described as male or female — even when the clinical details are identical — introduces a gendered layer of unreliability that undermines trust. This experiment probes whether GPT-5 exhibits such differential behavior under Edinburgh's real-world demographic composition.\n\nEdinburgh was evaluated with compositions of 90% white / 10% black (ethnicity), 40% male / 60% female (gender — female is the population majority, but male is treated as the \"majority\" group in the experimental framework), and 90% high-income / 10% low-income (SES). The same 10 clinical scenarios were presented with and without demographic cues, measuring consistency and accuracy against a demographic-free baseline (baseline accuracy = 0.90). Edinburgh is the only city where the framework's \"majority\" group (male) is the actual population minority, making it the most sensitive probe of gender-related behavioral asymmetry.",
      "findings": "GPT-5 achieves complete demographic invariance under Edinburgh's compositions — a result that stands in sharp contrast to Claude Sonnet 4.6's performance on the same test. All three bias axes produce perfect 1.0 consistency ratios and 1.0 accuracy ratios. City accuracy remains 0.90, identical to baseline. The gender result is particularly significant: Edinburgh's 40/60 male/female split — where the framework's designated \"majority\" is actually the population minority — provides the most asymmetric gender test in the experiment. Claude exhibited a consistency ratio of 1.200 on this exact dimension, the strongest single bias signal in the entire evaluation, indicating 20% more answer-switching for female-framed scenarios. GPT-5 shows zero such asymmetry. The ethnicity result is equally striking: where Claude showed a universal 0.889 consistency ratio under the same 90/10 composition, GPT-5 maintains perfect invariance. SES at 1.0 is consistent with both models. The combined cleanliness across all three dimensions — particularly on Edinburgh's deliberately challenging gender split — demonstrates that GPT-5's reasoning pathways are fundamentally insensitive to demographic framing in a way that Claude's are not.",
      "verdict": "RECOMMENDED. All consistency and accuracy ratios are 1.0 across ethnicity, gender, and SES. GPT-5 eliminates the dual fairness violation that Claude exhibited in Edinburgh (gender 1.200, ethnicity 0.889), demonstrating complete demographic invariance.",
      "recommendation": "No demographic remediation is required for Edinburgh deployment. The elimination of Claude's gender and ethnicity biases represents a genuine architectural improvement. Continue monitoring as scenario sets expand, particularly on the gender dimension given Edinburgh's 60% female majority."

    "disease_only": {
      "summary": "Even a high-performing model can create health inequities if its performance is concentrated in some disease domains and weak in others — because different cities carry different disease burdens. This experiment tests whether GPT-5's clinical competence is balanced across the disease domains most relevant to Edinburgh, or whether composition-driven luck is masking domain-specific weaknesses.\n\nEdinburgh's clinical scenario mix reflects its normalized disease burden: cancer (54.4%), cardiovascular (23.9%), and respiratory (21.7%). All 100 scenarios produced valid responses. Performance was measured via accuracy and macro F1 at both the aggregate and per-disease level.",
      "findings": "Edinburgh achieves 92.0% aggregate accuracy (F1 = 0.921) with zero invalid responses, matching London's aggregate exactly but with a strikingly different internal profile. Cancer performance is strong at 98.1% (F1 = 0.979), nearly matching London's perfect score. Cardiovascular is the standout improvement: 92.3% accuracy (F1 = 0.914) is the second-highest domain score across all GPT-5 cities and a solid clinical result. However, respiratory collapses to 77.3% (F1 = 0.757) — a 20.8-point gap below cancer and the most severe single-domain deficit in the entire GPT-5 evaluation. This is also notably worse than Claude Sonnet 4.6's 86.4% respiratory accuracy on the same Edinburgh scenario set, making it the only domain where GPT-5 substantially underperforms Claude. The respiratory weakness is particularly consequential because it accounts for 21.7% of Edinburgh's disease burden: roughly one in five clinically relevant interactions falls in the model's weakest area, where it gets nearly one in four scenarios wrong. Edinburgh's strong aggregate of 92.0% is composition-driven — cancer and cardiovascular combined represent 78.3% of the disease mix, and the model excels in both. But the 20.8-point within-city spread reveals that this aggregate conceals a critical respiratory blind spot that would disproportionately harm patients with respiratory conditions.",
      "verdict": "NOT RECOMMENDED. The 77.3% respiratory accuracy (F1 = 0.757) — covering 21.7% of Edinburgh's disease burden — falls below clinical deployment thresholds and is worse than Claude's 86.4% on the same scenarios. The 20.8-point within-city spread between cancer (98.1%) and respiratory (77.3%) indicates a structural competence gap.",
      "recommendation": "Conduct substantial enrichment of the respiratory medicine training corpus to close the 20.8-point gap with cancer and push respiratory accuracy above 90%. Investigate why GPT-5 specifically underperforms Claude Sonnet 4.6 on Edinburgh's respiratory scenarios (77.3% vs. 86.4%): the regression may indicate training trade-offs where improved performance in other domains came at the cost of respiratory calibration."

      "summary": "Edinburgh was tested with counterfactual fairness demographic compositions of 90% white / 10% black (ethnicity), 40% male / 60% female (gender — note: female is the *majority* in real population but male is treated as the \"majority\" group in the framework), and 90% high-income / 10% low-income (SES). The disease-domain assessment mix reflects Edinburgh's disease burden: cancer (54.4%), cardiovascular (23.9%), and respiratory (21.7%).",
      "findings": "Edinburgh under GPT-5 presents the inverse of Claude's profile: where Claude combined the experiment's strongest clinical competence (94.0% aggregate) with its most severe fairness violation (gender consistency 1.200), GPT-5 achieves perfect demographic invariance but introduces a worse respiratory deficit. All consistency ratios and accuracy ratios are 1.0 across ethnicity, gender, and SES — completely eliminating Claude's dual gender/ethnicity bias. However, respiratory accuracy drops to 77.3% (F1 = 0.757), worse than Claude's 86.4%, creating a 20.8-point within-city spread against cancer (98.1%). Cancer and cardiovascular (92.3%) are strong, and the 92.0% aggregate is solid, but the respiratory floor means one in four respiratory scenarios is answered incorrectly in a domain covering 21.7% of Edinburgh's burden. The trade-off is clear: GPT-5 delivers equitable but respiratory-impaired service, while Claude delivered competent but gender-biased service. Neither profile is fully deployment-ready, but the nature of the remediation differs — GPT-5 needs domain enrichment, while Claude needs fairness augmentation.",
      "verdict": "NOT RECOMMENDED. Despite achieving perfect demographic fairness (eliminating Claude's gender 1.200 and ethnicity 0.889 violations), the 77.3% respiratory accuracy covering 21.7% of Edinburgh's burden falls below clinical deployment thresholds.",
      "recommendation": "Conduct substantial respiratory medicine corpus enrichment to close the 20.8-point gap with cancer and push respiratory accuracy above 90%. Investigate the GPT-5-specific respiratory regression relative to Claude (77.3% vs. 86.4%) to avoid reintroducing the deficit in future iterations. No demographic remediation is needed — GPT-5's complete fairness invariance in Edinburgh is a genuine model-level advantage."
