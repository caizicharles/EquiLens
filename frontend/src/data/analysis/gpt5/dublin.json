      "summary": "Counterfactual fairness demands that a model's output should not change when only a patient's demographic attributes are altered while all clinical facts remain constant. Dublin provides a particularly informative test case because its 50/50 gender split offers the most symmetric and statistically balanced probe of gender fairness among the three cities.\n\nDublin was evaluated with demographic compositions of 90% white / 10% black (ethnicity), 50% male / 50% female (gender), and 80% high-income / 20% low-income (SES). Ten clinical scenarios were each presented with and without demographic cues, measuring consistency and accuracy against a demographic-free baseline (baseline accuracy = 0.90).",
      "findings": "GPT-5 produces zero detectable bias under Dublin's compositions. All three bias axes — ethnicity, gender, and SES — yield perfect 1.0 consistency ratios and 1.0 accuracy ratios. City accuracy remains 0.90, identical to baseline. Dublin's 50/50 gender split provides the most rigorous and symmetric test of gender fairness in the experiment, and the clean result confirms that GPT-5's gender-invariant behavior is genuine rather than an artifact of skewed composition. Dublin also represents the most asymmetric SES test at 80/20 high-income/low-income (vs. 90/10 elsewhere), and GPT-5 remains invariant even under this wider income gap. Where Claude Sonnet 4.6 exhibited a universal ethnicity signal of 0.889 under Dublin's identical 90/10 white/black composition — a model-level vulnerability that appeared across all cities — GPT-5 shows no such signal. The complete elimination of the ethnicity asymmetry, which Claude shared across all three cities, confirms that GPT-5 has achieved a qualitatively different level of demographic invariance at the architectural level.",
      "verdict": "RECOMMENDED. All consistency and accuracy ratios are 1.0 across ethnicity, gender, and SES. Dublin's balanced 50/50 gender split and wider 80/20 SES gap provide particularly credible clean signals. GPT-5 eliminates even the shared model-level ethnicity signal (0.889) that persisted across all Claude evaluations.",
      "recommendation": "No demographic remediation is required for Dublin deployment. Continue monitoring consistency ratios as scenario sets scale, particularly on the ethnicity dimension where Claude showed a universal signal, to confirm GPT-5's invariance holds under larger and more diverse samples."

      "summary": "When a model underperforms not in one domain but across all of them, the concern shifts from a specific blind spot to a systemic competence issue — suggesting the model may be poorly calibrated to the clinical patterns most relevant to a given population. This experiment tests whether GPT-5's performance across Dublin's disease burden reveals isolated gaps or a broader weakness.\n\nDublin's clinical scenario mix reflects its disease burden, which features a notably higher cardiovascular weight than the other cities: cancer (42.5%), cardiovascular (39.7%), and respiratory (17.8%). All 100 scenarios produced valid responses. Performance was measured via accuracy and macro F1 at both the aggregate and per-disease level.",
      "findings": "Dublin achieves 89.0% aggregate accuracy (F1 = 0.880) — the weakest of the three GPT-5 cities, but with the most balanced cross-domain profile. The within-city spread is just 3.2 points: cancer at 90.7% (F1 = 0.909), cardiovascular at 87.8% (F1 = 0.860), and respiratory at 87.5% (F1 = 0.834). This tight clustering contrasts dramatically with London's 20.8-point spread and Edinburgh's 20.8-point spread, suggesting GPT-5 is more evenly calibrated across Dublin's disease mix than the other cities'. Respiratory at 87.5% is the standout improvement relative to Claude Sonnet 4.6's 75.0% on the same scenarios — a 12.5-point gain that lifts the absolute floor from clinically dangerous to borderline serviceable. Cancer at 90.7% remains the weakest cancer performance across all cities (vs. 100% London, 98.1% Edinburgh) but clears the 90% threshold. Cardiovascular at 87.8% is the most consequential metric: it represents 39.7% of Dublin's disease burden — the highest cardiovascular weight across all cities — and while it meets minimum viability, the margin is thin. The uniform calibration may partly reflect Dublin's topic mix drawing from moderately difficult subtopics rather than concentrating in extreme domains, but the 4-point improvement over Claude's 85.0% aggregate indicates genuine model-level improvement across the board.",
      "verdict": "CONDITIONALLY RECOMMENDED. The 89.0% aggregate accuracy with a tight 3.2-point within-city spread and zero invalid responses approaches deployment thresholds. However, cardiovascular at 87.8% against a 39.7% disease burden — the highest cardiovascular weight across all cities — leaves insufficient margin for a domain that drives nearly four in ten clinical interactions.",
      "recommendation": "Apply targeted cardiovascular and respiratory medicine enrichment, prioritizing the combined 57.5% weight these two domains carry in Dublin's disease profile. Focus on Irish and UK clinical guidelines and epidemiological contexts given Dublin's topic mix. The goal is to push cardiovascular above 90% — the binding constraint given its 39.7% burden weight — while maintaining the balanced cross-domain profile that is Dublin's defining strength."

      "summary": "Dublin's counterfactual fairness compositions are 90% white / 10% black, 50% male / 50% female, and 80% high-income / 20% low-income. The disease-domain assessment mix reflects Dublin's higher cardiovascular burden: cancer (42.5%), cardiovascular (39.7%), and respiratory (17.8%).",
      "findings": "Dublin emerges as GPT-5's most deployment-viable city — the cleanest combined profile across both dimensions. Demographic fairness is perfect: all consistency ratios and accuracy ratios are 1.0 across ethnicity, gender, and SES, with Dublin's 50/50 gender split providing the most credible clean gender signal in the experiment. The disease-domain profile, while the weakest in aggregate (89.0%, F1 = 0.880), exhibits the tightest within-city spread at 3.2 points: cancer 90.7%, cardiovascular 87.8%, respiratory 87.5%. This balance means Dublin residents would receive roughly equivalent quality of service regardless of their clinical domain — a more equitable service profile than London's 20.8-point neuro gap or Edinburgh's 20.8-point respiratory gap, even though the absolute performance level is lower. The improvement over Claude is significant: Claude's Dublin combined 85.0% aggregate with respiratory at 75.0% alongside a 0.889 ethnicity signal; GPT-5 delivers 89.0% aggregate with respiratory at 87.5% and zero fairness violations. The remaining constraint is cardiovascular at 87.8% against a 39.7% burden: this domain drives nearly four in ten clinical interactions in Dublin, and performance needs to clear 90% for confident deployment.",
      "verdict": "CONDITIONALLY RECOMMENDED. GPT-5 in Dublin achieves the experiment's cleanest combined profile: perfect demographic fairness, the tightest disease-domain spread (3.2 points), and meaningful improvement over Claude across both dimensions. The 89.0% aggregate and 87.8% cardiovascular accuracy against a 39.7% burden remain borderline, pending targeted enrichment to clear 90%.",
      "recommendation": "Apply targeted cardiovascular medicine enrichment to push accuracy above 90%, addressing the binding constraint for Dublin's 39.7% cardiovascular burden weight. No demographic remediation is needed. Dublin's combination of perfect fairness and balanced domain competence positions it as the most deployment-ready city for GPT-5 once the marginal cardiovascular gap is closed."
